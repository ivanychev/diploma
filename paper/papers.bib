abstract = {Abstract—Inthis study, heartbeat time series are classified using support vector machines (SVMs). Statistical methods and signal analysis techniques are used to extract features from the signals. The SVMclassifier is favorably compared to other neural network- based classification approaches by performing leave-one-out cross validation. The performance of the SVM with respect to other state-of-the-art classifiers is also confirmed by the classification of signals presenting very low signal-to-noise ratio. Finally, the influence of the number of features to the classification rate was also investigated for two real datasets. The first dataset consists of long-term ECG recordings of young and elderly healthy subjects. Thesecond dataset consists of long-termECGrecordings of normal subjects and subjects suffering from coronary artery disease. Index Terms—Feature extraction, heartbeat time series, heart rate variability (HRV), support vector machine (SVM). I.},

@article{Eads2002,
abstract = {We introduce an algorithm for classifying time series data. Since our initial application is for lightning data, we call the algorithm Zeus. Zeus is a hybrid algorithm that employs evolutionary computation for feature extraction, and a support vector machine for the final "backend" classification. Support vector machines have a reputation for classifying in high-dimensional spaces without overfitting, so the utility of reducing dimensionality with an intermediate feature selection step has been questioned. We address this question by testing Zeus on a lightning classification task using data acquired from the Fast On-orbit Recording of Transient Events (FORTE) satellite.},

abstract = {Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are a widely used tool for the prediction of time series. In this paper we use the dynamic behaviour of the RNN to categorize input sequences into different specified classes. These two tasks do not seem to have much in common. However, the prediction task strongly supports the development of a suitable internal structure, representing the main features of the input sequence, to solve the classification problem. Therefore, the speed and success of the training as well as the generalization ability of the trained RNN are significantly improved. The trained RNN provides good classification performance and enables the user to assess efficiently the degree of reliability of the classification result. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

@inproceedings{Zheng2014,
abstract = {Time series (particularly multivariate) classification has drawn a lot of attention in the literature because of its broad applications for different domains, such as health informatics and bioinformatics. Thus, many algorithms have been developed for this task. Among them, nearest neighbor classification (particularly 1-NN) combined with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) achieves the state of the art performance. However, when data set grows larger, the time consumption of 1-NN with DTW grows linearly. Compared to 1-NN with DTW, the traditional feature-based classification methods are usually more efficient but less effective since their performance is usually dependent on the quality of hand-crafted features. To that end, in this paper, we explore the feature learning techniques to improve the performance of traditional feature-based approaches. Specifically, we propose a novel deep learning framework for multivariate time series classification. We conduct two groups of experiments on real-world data sets from different application domains. The final results show that our model is not only more efficient than the state of the art but also competitive in accuracy. It also demonstrates that feature learning is worth to investigate for time series classification.},
